Main Idea: Setting up parents/toddlers networks/connections for play/interactions between toddlers to address a lack of socialization due to COVID-19 and moving forward into a post-COVID world.

Curated experiences for kids! An app for going on adventures with new friends (like scavenger hunts, "treasure" hunts, nature hikes). Similar premise of meeting other parents on the app for the purpose of playdates but with a more concrete structure. maybe adventures can be created by users and/or sponsored content that is provided by businesses who pay for exposure and sales.
